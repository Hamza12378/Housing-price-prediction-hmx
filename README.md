# Housing-price-prediction-hmx
This repository contains a housing price prediction implementation in a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook is dedicated to forecasting housing prices using a machine-learning model.

# Dataset: 
For this project, we utilize the built-in dataset often found in popular machine learning libraries. This dataset contains a wealth of information about various houses, including attributes such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more, as well as their corresponding sale prices. The dataset comes preprocessed and ready for model training.

# Methodology: 
The project adheres to the following key steps:

**Data Preprocessing:** This phase encompasses data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering to ensure the dataset is well-prepared for machine learning modeling.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Through data visualization and statistical analysis, we delve into the relationships between various house attributes and their sale prices, gathering valuable insights.

**Feature Selection:** Identifying and selecting the most influential features that significantly impact house prices

**Model Selection:** A thorough evaluation of various machine learning algorithms is performed to choose the most appropriate one for the prediction task.

**Model Training:**  Using the curated dataset, the selected machine learning model is trained.

**Model Evaluation:** We evaluate the model's performance using a variety of metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), R-squared, and others to assess its effectiveness in predicting house prices.
